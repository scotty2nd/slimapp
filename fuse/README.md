# Video Login Screen Fuse Example
Example project to accompany the "[Video Login Screen Example](https://youtu.be/zfiz-yI4VWY)" Fuse tutorial video. This is a very basic example made to show how easy it is to build a classic login screen with a video background. All relevant code is in the `MainView.ux` file.

## Fuse version
This example was produced with Fuse (beta) v0.9.2. It was tested on Mac OS X 10.10.5. It was later updated to be compatible with Fuse 0.20 and onwards.

## Branches
The "finished product" is on the `master` branch, and the template I started with in the video is on the `starting-template` branch.
